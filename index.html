        - A photograph of yourself (This is to help me learn your name. After a few weeks, you can replace this with a photo of something else if you like).

            <p>My name is Brandon Bullock but my friends call me Enoah (Noah for short). This is my second attempt at Javascript and I am excited to figure this 
            out and learn how it can be utilized in my career. Im studying Software Development and Machanical Design at the Tech and this would techincally 
            be the begining of my 3rd year.</p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies include Table Top games (such as Pathfinder, Warhammer, Magic the Gathering) and the much more time friendly category Video Games 
            (EldenRing, Darksouls, FinalFantasy). I've not had much time to delve into my hobbies but since last seemster I've backed off some of my commitments to 
            better focus on school and take better care of myself. Looking forward to a great Semester!</p>
